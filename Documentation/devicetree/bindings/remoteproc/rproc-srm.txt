Remoteproc System Resource Manager
----------------------------------

The remoteproc SRM (System Resource Manager) handles resources allocated
to remote processors.
This makes it possible for remote proc to reserve and initialize system
resources for a peripheral assigned to a coprocessor.

The devices are grouped in a core node

Core
====
Required properties:
- compatible: should be "rproc-srm-core"

Dev
===
Required properties:
- compatible: should be "rproc-srm-dev"

Optional properties:
- reg: register base address and length
- clocks: clocks required by the coprocessor
- clock-names: see clock-bindings.txt
- pinctrl-x: pins configurations required by the coprocessor
- pinctrl-names: see pinctrl-bindings.txt.
	"rproc_default" is a special pin configuration which is applied except
	if the 'early-booted' property is set.
	In a general way, it is recommended to use names prefixed with "rproc_".
- x-supply: power supplies required by the coprocessor
- interrupts: see interrupts.txt
- interrupt-parent: see interrupts.txt
- interrupt-names: see interrupts.txt

Example:
	system_resources {
		compatible = "rproc-srm-core";

		mmc0: sdhci@09060000 {
			compatible = "rproc-srm-dev";
			reg = <0x09060000 0x100>;
			pinctrl-names = "rproc_default", "rproc_idle";
			pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_mmc0>;
			pinctrl-1 = <&pinctrl_mmc1>;
			clock-names = "mmc", "icn";
			clocks = <&clk_s_c0_flexgen CLK_MMC_0>,
				 <&clk_s_c0_flexgen CLK_RX_ICN_HVA>;
			vdda-supply = <&vdda>;
		};

		button {
			compatible = "rproc-srm-dev";
			interrupt-parent = <&gpioa>;
			interrupts = <5 1>;
			interrupt-names = "gpio_key";
		};
	};
